        Clopen Analysis is an online compendium about real analysis, specializing in measure theory. The material is at the level of a graduate-level course in real analysis.

    <p class="BodyText">
      The main novelty of Clopen Analysis is that it is freely available, and written by volunteers on the internet, possibly including you.
      In fact, any reader can contribute content to Clopen Analysis via GitHub, and Clopen Analysis is dependent on the contributions of its readers.
      Decisions about the content of Clopen Analysis shall be made by clear community consensus, or a majority vote if consensus is unclear.
      At least for the present, Aidan Backus manages the project, but this is subject to change.
